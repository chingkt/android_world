----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Broccoli"}
Reason: The user wants to add recipes to the "Broccoli" app.  I need to open the Broccoli app to begin.

If it's not installed, the action will have no effect, and I'll have to mark the task as infeasible.
Summary: Summary of this step: Opened the Broccoli app successfully.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "An ideal recipe for experimenting with different flavors and ingredients.", "index": 8}
