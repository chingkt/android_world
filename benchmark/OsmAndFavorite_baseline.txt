Running task: OsmAndFavorite
============================
Running task OsmAndFavorite with goal "Add a favorite location marker for 47.1303814, 9.5930117 in the OsmAnd maps app."
----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "OsmAnd"}
Reason: The goal is to add a favorite location marker in OsmAnd. OsmAnd is not on the home screen, so the first step is to open the OsmAnd app.
Summary: Summary of this step: Opened OsmAnd app successfully.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "long_press", "index": 1}
Reason: I need to long-press the map to bring up the context menu for adding a favorite location.
Summary: Long-pressed the map to bring up the context menu, which was successful and now shows options like "DETAILS" and "NAVIGATION".

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: The current location is not the desired location. I need to navigate to the desired coordinates.  Since I can't directly input coordinates, I'll click "DETAILS" to get more options, hoping to find a search or go-to function.
Summary: Clicked "DETAILS" to access more options and potentially a search/go-to function, but it unexpectedly opened a slightly different context menu with "COLLAPSE" instead.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "long_press", "index": 0}
Reason: The app opened a different context menu than expected.  I'll try a long press on a different part of the map to see if I can get the correct context menu with the option to add a favorite location.
Summary: Long-pressed the map to try to bring up the correct context menu for adding a favorite, but the same context menu appeared.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 14}
Reason: The More… button (index 14) might offer options for adding a favorite location or navigating to the desired coordinates. It's worth exploring this option since long-pressing and clicking DETAILS didn't work as expected.
Summary: Clicked "More…" (index 14) to explore options for adding favorite location, which successfully opened the map markers menu.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: We are in the Map Markers menu.  We need to add a new marker. We can try clicking the "More" options button (index 6) to see if it offers an "Add Marker" option.
Summary: Clicked "More" (index 6) to access additional options, successfully revealing a menu with options like "Sort by", "Appearance on the map", "Coordinate input", etc.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 10}
Reason: The goal is to add a favorite location marker with specific coordinates. "Coordinate input" (index 10) suggests a way to directly enter coordinates, which is the most straightforward approach. Clicking this option should open a coordinate input field.
Summary: Clicked "Coordinate input" to enter the desired coordinates, which successfully opened a coordinate input screen.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "47", "index": 4}
Reason: Input the latitude 47.1303814 into the latitude field. This involves inputting 47 into the first field (index 4), 13 into the second field (index 6), and 038 into the third field (index 8). Starting with the first field.
Summary: Summary of this step: Entered "47" into the first latitude input field (index 4) as the first part of the latitude 47.1303814.

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: We have entered "47" for the latitude. Now we need to enter ".1303814" to complete the latitude input. We will click the next field (index 6) and enter the remaining digits.
Summary: Clicked the second latitude input field (index 6) to enter the next part of the latitude value, preparing to input ".1303814".

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": ".1303814", "index": 6}
Reason: We have clicked into the second latitude input field (index 6) in the previous step. Now we can input the remaining part of the latitude value, which is ".1303814".
Summary: Summary of this step: Inputted ".1303814" into the second latitude field (index 6); the field now displays "13".

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 9}
Reason: The latitude input field (index 6) currently displays "13" instead of the intended ".1303814". This likely happened because the OsmAnd app automatically truncated the input. To correct this, I will click the backspace button (index 9) to remove the existing input and then re-enter the full latitude value.
Summary: Clicked the latitude backspace button (index 9) to clear the latitude input field; the field now shows the hint text "xx" instead of "47".

Completed step 11.
----------step 12
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 4}
Reason: The latitude input needs to be corrected to 47.1303814.  Currently, the first field is empty ("xx") and the second field has "13". I'll click the first latitude field (index 4) to start entering the correct value.
Summary: Clicked the first latitude input field (index 4) to begin entering "47".

Completed step 12.
----------step 13
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "47.1303814", "index": 4}
Reason: We incorrectly entered the latitude as "13" instead of "47.1303814". We need to clear the current input and enter the correct value. Since the first latitude field (index 4) is currently selected and shows "xx", we will input the entire latitude value into this field directly.
Summary: Entered "47.1303814" into the latitude field (index 4); the field now displays "47", "13", and "038" correctly.

Completed step 13.

Running task OsmAndFavorite with goal "Add a favorite location marker for Malbun, Liechtenstein in the OsmAnd maps app."
----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "OsmAnd"}
Reason: The goal is to add a favorite location in OsmAnd. OsmAnd is not on the home screen, so the first step is to open the app.
Summary: Opened OsmAnd app to add favorite location.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 4}
Reason: Click the search button to search for the location.
Summary: Clicked the search button (index 4) to initiate a search for the location, which successfully opened the search menu.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "wait"}
Reason: I need to input the location "Malbun, Liechtenstein" into the search bar.  I am assuming that after clicking the search button (in the previous step), a search bar will appear on the screen. I will need to wait for the UI to update to reflect this change.
Summary: Waited for the UI to update after clicking "Search," but the screenshots are identical, suggesting the UI hasn't changed as expected.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: The UI doesn't seem to have updated after clicking search. I'll try clicking it again.
Summary: Clicked "Search" again, but the UI didn't change, suggesting the click might not have registered or the app is unresponsive.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The app seems to be stuck or unresponsive.  Navigating back and attempting the search again might resolve the issue.
Summary: Navigated back from a seemingly unresponsive OsmAnd search screen to try the search again.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Error calling LLM, will retry in {retry_delay} seconds
None Stream removed
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "OsmAnd"}
Reason: The app seems to be stuck. I'll try closing and reopening it to see if that resolves the issue.
Summary: Restarted OsmAnd app, but the map view remains unchanged.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: The app seems to be stuck or unresponsive to clicks on the search button.  Since restarting and navigating back didn't resolve the issue, I'll try clicking the search button one more time, as sometimes UI elements can be temporarily unresponsive. If this doesn't work, I'll consider other options like clearing the app's cache or reinstalling it.
Summary: Clicked the search button (index 3) again, hoping to activate the search functionality, but the UI did not change, suggesting the app is still unresponsive.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "Malbun, Liechtenstein", "index": 2}
Reason: The app seems to be unresponsive to clicks on the search button.  A restart didn't help, and clicking the search area also didn't work. Let's try inputting the search text directly into the search bar (index 2) to see if that triggers the search functionality.
Summary: Inputted "Malbun, Liechtenstein" directly into the search bar (index 2); the search did not execute, instead showing a "Could not find anything" message.

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 10}
Reason: The search is failing for "Malbun, Liechtenstein".  The app suggests increasing the search radius. I will try that.
Summary: Clicked "INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS" (index 10) to expand the search area, as the initial search for "Malbun, Liechtenstein" yielded no results.

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 9}
Reason: The search radius has been increased, but it still shows "Liechtenstein" and "5890 mi" which indicates that it hasn't found Malbun yet.  It's possible the search radius isn't large enough, or there's a connectivity issue preventing the search from completing. I'll try increasing the search radius again.
Summary: Clicked "INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS" (index 9) to expand the search area for Malbun, but the result still shows Liechtenstein as a country and a large distance, suggesting the target location hasn't been found yet, possibly due to insufficient search radius or connectivity issues.

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The app seems to be having trouble finding Malbun, even with an increased search radius.  Since the UI is not responding as expected, and restarting the app and increasing the search radius haven't worked, it's best to try a different approach. I'll navigate back to the map view and try long-pressing on the map to see if I can set a favorite location that way.
Summary: Navigated back to the map view to try a different approach for adding the favorite location, since the search wasn't working as expected.

Completed step 11.
----------step 12
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_home"}
Reason: Since the search functionality within the OsmAnd app is not working as expected, and direct input isn't leading to the desired location, it's best to try a different approach.  Let's navigate to the home screen and try searching for "Malbun, Liechtenstein" using a general search engine like Google Maps, which might offer a more reliable way to find the coordinates or a way to share the location with OsmAnd.
Summary: Navigated to the home screen to try a different approach for finding Malbun, Liechtenstein, since the in-app search in OsmAnd wasn't working.

Completed step 12.
----------step 13
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Chrome"}
Reason: The OsmAnd app is not responding to searches as expected.  It may be helpful to try searching for the location using a general search engine like Google and then navigating to the location within OsmAnd if a link to the location is available. To do this, we need to open the Chrome app.
Summary: Opened Chrome app to search for the location online as OsmAnd searches were not working as expected.

Running task OsmAndFavorite with goal "Add a favorite location marker for 47.23976, 9.5262837 in the OsmAnd maps app."
----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "OsmAnd"}
Reason: The user wants to add a favorite location marker in OsmAnd. OsmAnd is not open, so the first step is to open the OsmAnd app.
Summary: Opened OsmAnd app successfully.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: I need to search for the coordinates provided. The "Search" button (index 3) will allow me to enter the coordinates.
Summary: Clicked the search button (index 3) to enter the provided coordinates, and the search screen appeared as expected.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "47.23976, 9.5262837", "index": 2}
Reason: I need to input the provided coordinates into the search bar. The search bar is at index 2.
Summary: Summary of this step: Entered the coordinates "47.23976, 9.5262837" into the search bar (index 2); the search result shows "47.23976° N, 9.52628° E" in Liechtenstein, which seems correct.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: The search result for the provided coordinates is displayed. Now, I need to interact with this result to add it as a favorite location. Clicking on the search result seems like the next logical step.
Summary: Clicked the search result "47.23976° N, 9.52628° E" to interact with it and potentially add it as a favorite location; the screen transitioned to the map view centered on the specified coordinates.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: Click "DETAILS" to view more information about the location and potentially find options to save or favorite it.
Summary: Clicked "DETAILS" to view more location information and find save/favorite options, but the button actually minimized the location information view.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 5}
Reason: The "COLLAPSE" button (index 5) is currently visible, and clicking it should expand the location information view, potentially revealing options to save or mark the location as a favorite.
Summary: Clicked "COLLAPSE" (index 5) to expand the location information view, but the screen remained unchanged, suggesting the button may not have worked as intended or the view is already expanded.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 5}
Reason: The current screen displays location details but doesn't offer a direct way to add a favorite.  The "COLLAPSE" button (index 5) didn't work as expected in the previous step, and clicking "DETAILS" (index 6) minimized the information view. I'll try clicking "COLLAPSE" again, hoping it might work this time and reveal more options, including potentially adding a favorite.
Summary: Clicked "COLLAPSE" (index 5) again to try and reveal more options, but the screen remained unchanged, indicating the button is not functional or the UI is stuck.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The current UI doesn't seem to offer a direct way to add a favorite.  The "COLLAPSE" button isn't working as expected, and there's no obvious "Save" or "Favorite" option. I'll try clicking the back button to see if it returns to a previous screen with more options or a different context menu.
Summary: Navigated back from the location context menu to explore other options for adding a favorite, as the current menu lacked relevant options.

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "47.23976, 9.5262837", "index": 1}
Reason: The app returned to the search screen.  I'll re-enter the coordinates and try a long-press on the result this time, hoping it might offer different interaction options.
Summary: Re-entered coordinates "47.23976, 9.5262837" in the search bar; the UI shows the keyboard.

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "keyboard_enter"}
Reason: The keyboard is shown because of the previous input.  Need to dismiss the keyboard and click the search result again to get to the map view.
Summary: Pressed enter to dismiss the keyboard, but the map view did not appear as expected, possibly because the search result needs to be clicked again.

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The app seems to be in a strange state.  Navigating back to the search results and trying to select the location again might resolve the issue.
Error calling LLM, will retry in {retry_delay} seconds
None Stream removed
Summary: Navigated back from the blank screen, hoping to return to the search results and try selecting the location again.

Completed step 11.
----------step 12
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 2}
Reason: The app seems to be in a slightly unusual state after navigating back and forth.  I'll try clearing the search bar and re-entering the coordinates to see if that helps get back to the expected map view with location details.
Summary: Clicked the clear button (index 2) in the search bar to reset the search field, but the map view did not appear as expected.

Completed step 12.
----------step 13
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 11}
Reason: The current screen is the search screen. I need to click the search result for the entered coordinates to navigate to the map view centered on those coordinates.  From there, I can try a long press to see if it brings up options for adding a favorite.
Summary: Clicked the search result "47.23976° N, 9.52628° E" to navigate to the map; the map opened as expected, showing Liechtenstein.

Running task OsmAndFavorite with goal "Add a favorite location marker for Malbun, Liechtenstein in the OsmAnd maps app."
----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "OsmAnd"}
Reason: The goal is to add a favorite location in OsmAnd. OsmAnd is not on the home screen, so the first step is to open the app.
Summary: Summary of this step: Opened OsmAnd app successfully.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 4}
Reason: Clicking the search button to search for the location.
Summary: Clicked the search button (index 4) to search for the location, and the screen transitioned to the main menu.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: I'm looking for the "Search" option in the menu to search for the location Malbun, Liechtenstein.
Summary: Clicked "Search" in the main menu to initiate a search for the desired location, which successfully opened the search bar.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "Malbun, Liechtenstein", "index": 2}
Reason: I need to input the location "Malbun, Liechtenstein" into the search bar.  Element 2 is the search bar edit text.
Summary: Summary of this step: Typed "Malbun, Liechtenstein" into the search bar (element 2); search results are displayed, but no exact match found, prompting options to increase search radius or refine search.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 10}
Reason: The search did not return the exact location.  I will increase the search radius as suggested by the app to see if Malbun appears in the expanded search.
Summary: Clicked "INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS" (index 10) to expand the search area, as the initial search for "Malbun, Liechtenstein" did not yield the desired result.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The search returned "Liechtenstein" as a country. This is not the specific location we are looking for.  We need to refine the search or look for a more precise result. Since the exact match wasn't found initially, clicking on the country name might take us to the map centered on Liechtenstein, which is too broad.  We'll try scrolling down to see if more specific results appear after increasing the search radius.
Summary: Scrolled down to see more search results, but the screen content remained unchanged, suggesting no more specific results are available.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "Vaduz, Liechtenstein", "index": 1}
Reason: The search did not return the specific location Malbun.  Liechtenstein was found as a country. It's possible the location is too small or not precisely mapped in OsmAnd.  I'll try searching for a nearby larger city or town in Liechtenstein, hoping Malbun might be listed as a nearby place or point of interest.  I'll search for "Vaduz, Liechtenstein" since Vaduz is the capital.
Summary: Summary of this step: Searched for "Vaduz, Liechtenstein" (instead of Malbun) as Malbun wasn't found and Vaduz is the capital, hoping to find Malbun as a nearby POI; search returned no results within 5mi of Vaduz.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: Since the search for "Malbun, Liechtenstein" and even the broader search around Vaduz didn't work, I'll clear the current search text and try searching for "Malbun" alone.  This simplifies the search and might yield a different result.
Summary: Clicked the clear button (index 3) to remove the previous search text, preparing to search for just "Malbun".

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "Malbun", "index": 2}
Reason: Since the search for "Malbun, Liechtenstein" didn't return the exact location and increasing the search radius didn't help, I'll try searching for just "Malbun" to see if it can be found without specifying the country.
Summary: Typed "Malbun" in the search bar; search returned no results within 5mi radius, suggesting to increase search radius or change search.

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "Triesenberg, Liechtenstein", "index": 2}
Reason: Since the search for "Malbun" yielded no results within a reasonable radius, and increasing the search radius didn't help, it's likely that the location is not precisely mapped in OsmAnd.  I'll try searching for a nearby, larger town in Liechtenstein, and then try to find Malbun manually on the map.
Summary: Summary of this step: Added "Triesenberg, Liechtenstein" to the search bar to find a nearby town, as "Malbun" alone yielded no results, even with an increased search radius.

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: Since the search for "Triesenberg, Liechtenstein" didn't directly locate Malbun, I will clear the search bar and try searching for "Malbun Ski Resort" to be more specific.
Summary: Clicked the clear button (index 3) to remove the previous search term, preparing to search for "Malbun Ski Resort".

Completed step 11.
----------step 12
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "Malbun Ski Resort", "index": 2}
Reason: Searching for "Malbun Ski Resort" as a more specific term might yield better results than just "Malbun".
Summary: Typed "Malbun Ski Resort" into the search bar (index 2); search results are displayed, but no location in Liechtenstein is found, only one in Austria.

Completed step 12.
----------step 13
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: The search for "Malbun Ski Resort" yielded a result in Austria, but not in Liechtenstein.  Since the goal is to add a favorite location *in Liechtenstein*, I'll try searching for "Malbun" and increasing the search radius again, in case the ski resort listing is obscuring the town itself.
Summary: Clicked the clear button (index 3) to remove the previous search term, "Malbun Ski Resort".

None Stream removed
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "OsmAnd"}
Reason: The OsmAnd app needs to be opened to add a favorite location marker.
Summary: Summary of this step: Opened OsmAnd to add a favorite location marker.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "long_press", "index": 1}
Reason: Long press the map to bring up the context menu for adding a favorite location.
Summary: Long-pressed the map to bring up the context menu, which appeared successfully with options like "DETAILS" and "NAVIGATION".

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: The next step is to click "DETAILS" to view the details of the selected location and add a favorite marker there.
Summary: Clicked "DETAILS" to view location details and add a favorite marker; the details view opened as expected.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 5}
Reason: I need to add a favorite marker at the specified coordinates. Since the current location is not the desired one (coordinates shown at the bottom of the screen are different), I need to navigate to the correct location first. I'll click the "COLLAPSE" button to go back to the map view where I can navigate.
Summary: Clicked "COLLAPSE" to return to the map view so I can navigate to the desired coordinates.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: I need to navigate to the specified coordinates. Since I don't have a direct input method for coordinates, I'll use the search function.  I'll go back to the details view to access the search bar.
Summary: Clicked "DETAILS" to return to the details view, intending to access the search bar; however, the button clicked was at the bottom of the screen and resulted in a slightly different view with "COLLAPSE" at the bottom.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: Click "COLLAPSE" to go back to the map view and try a long press to bring up the context menu again.  From there, we should be able to add the favorite marker using the coordinates.
Summary: Clicked the collapse button (index 1) to return to the map view so the location can be long-pressed to add a favorite marker.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: I need to long-press the map at the coordinates 47.1858882, 9.5452201. Since I don't have a way to enter coordinates directly, I'll try to zoom in and navigate to the approximate location visually.
Summary: Summary of this step: Clicked the zoom in button (index 1) to zoom in on the map, in order to visually navigate to the coordinates 47.1858882, 9.5452201 for a long press; the screenshots are identical, suggesting the click did not register or the map needs time to update.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: The click on the zoom in button in the previous step might not have registered. Trying to click it again before attempting other actions.
Summary: Clicked "Zoom in" (index 1) again because the map didn't seem to zoom in as expected in the previous step; unsure if the click registered.

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 2}
Reason: The map has not zoomed in after several clicks on the zoom in button.  I will try zooming out first, and then back in, in case the map is stuck.
Summary: Summary of this step: Clicked the zoom out button (index 2) to see if it resolves the map being stuck; the screenshots are identical, suggesting the map is unresponsive.

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "wait"}
Reason: The map appears to be unresponsive to zoom in and zoom out clicks.  I'll try waiting a moment to see if it becomes responsive. If not, I may need to restart the app or try a different approach.
Summary: Waited for the map to respond to zoom in/out clicks, but it remains unresponsive.

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The map appears to be unresponsive to zoom in/out clicks.  A long press on the map is needed to bring up the context menu for adding a favorite marker, but the map's current state prevents interaction. Navigating back and attempting the long press again might resolve the issue.
Summary: Navigated back from the unresponsive map view to potentially reset its state and enable interaction for a long press.

Completed step 11.
----------step 12
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The map appears to be unresponsive to zoom and other interactions.  Navigating back and attempting to open the map again might resolve the issue and allow for a long press at the desired coordinates.
Summary: Navigated back to the home screen because the map was unresponsive; will try re-opening OsmAnd and long-pressing the coordinates.

Completed step 12.
----------step 13
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "OsmAnd"}
Reason: Re-open OsmAnd to try and add the favorite location marker.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "Sch\u00f6nberg, Liechtenstein", "index": 2}
Reason: Type the location name into the search bar.
Summary: Typed "Schönberg, Liechtenstein" into the search bar (index 2); search results are not yet visible, may need to increase search radius or select a specific result.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 10}
Reason: The search returned no results.  Element 8 shows "Could not find anything: 5 mi". Element 9 suggests increasing the search radius. Element 10 displays the button "INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS". Clicking this should expand the search.
Summary: Clicked "INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS" (index 10) to expand the search area, as no results were found for the initial 5 mile radius.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: The search returned "Liechtenstein" as a country, which is close to Schönberg.  We should click on this result to see if Schönberg is listed as a city/town within Liechtenstein.
Summary: Clicked "Liechtenstein" (index 6) in search results to see if Schönberg is listed within it; the map view opened, showing Liechtenstein, but Schönberg is not immediately visible.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: Schönberg is not visible on the map after searching for Liechtenstein.  I will zoom in to try and locate it within the country.
Summary: Zoomed in on the map by clicking the zoom in button, but Schönberg is still not visible.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: Schönberg is still not visible on the map.  Need to zoom in further to locate it.
Summary: Summary of this step: Zoomed in on the map by clicking the zoom in button, but Schönberg is still not visible.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: Schönberg is still not visible on the map. Zooming in further may help locate it.
Summary: Zoomed in on the map by clicking the zoom in button, but Schönberg is still not visible.

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: Schönberg is still not visible on the map.  I will zoom in further to try to locate it.
Summary: Summary of this step: Zoomed in on the map by clicking the zoom in button, but Schönberg is still not visible.

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: Schönberg is still not visible on the map.  Will zoom in further to try to locate it.
Summary: Zoomed in on the map using the zoom in button, but Schönberg is still not visible.

Completed step 11.
----------step 12
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 2}
Reason: Schönberg is still not visible on the map. It might be helpful to try zooming out to get a broader view and then try zooming in again in the correct area.
Summary: Zoomed out to get a broader view of the map, but Schönberg is still not visible.

Completed step 12.
----------step 13
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}

Running task OsmAndFavorite with goal "Add a favorite location marker for Nendeln, Liechtenstein in the OsmAnd maps app."
----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "OsmAnd"}
Reason: The goal is to add a favorite location marker in OsmAnd. OsmAnd is not on the home screen, so the first step is to open the app.
Summary: Summary of this step: Opened OsmAnd app successfully.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 4}
Reason: Click the search button to search for the location.
Summary: Clicked the search button (index 4) to initiate a search for the target location, which successfully opened the search menu.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "wait"}
Reason: The next step is to input the desired location "Nendeln, Liechtenstein" into the search bar.  Since the search menu has just been opened, the next step should be to locate the search bar (which is likely editable) and input the text. I'll wait for the UI to update to ensure the search bar is available.
Summary: Waited for the UI to update to ensure the search bar is available before inputting the location.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "Nendeln, Liechtenstein", "index": -1}
Reason: I need to input the location "Nendeln, Liechtenstein" into the search bar.  I'm assuming the search bar is now available after waiting in the previous step, and is likely an editable text field. I'll need to inspect the UI elements in the next step to identify the search bar's index. I'll try inputting the text directly, and if that fails, I'll try other methods like clicking the search bar first.
Some error happened executing the action  input_text
Invalid element index: -1, must be between 0 and 20.
Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "wait"}
Reason: The previous input text action failed. It's possible the search bar wasn't ready yet.  I'll wait a bit longer and try again.
Summary: Waited for the search bar to become available after the previous text input failed, but the screen did not change.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The app seems to be in an unexpected state after the search action. Navigating back and retrying the search might resolve the issue.
Summary: Navigated back to the map view from the search results page because the app was in an unexpected state.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: Retry clicking the search button and inputting the location.  The previous failure might have been a transient issue.
Summary: Clicked the search button to initiate a search for the desired location.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "Nendeln, Liechtenstein", "index": 2}
Reason: Input the location name "Nendeln, Liechtenstein" into the search bar.
Summary: Typed "Nendeln, Liechtenstein" into the search bar (index 2) to search for this location; search returned no results, but offered to increase search radius.

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 10}
Reason: The search for "Nendeln, Liechtenstein" yielded no results within the initial search radius.  The UI suggests increasing the search radius. Since the goal is to add a favorite location marker, it's likely just outside the initial search area. Clicking "INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS" might locate Nendeln.
Summary: Clicked "INCREASE SEARCH RADIUS" to expand the search area, as the initial search didn't find Nendeln, Liechtenstein.

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "Nendeln village, Liechtenstein", "index": 1}
Reason: The search returned "Liechtenstein" as a country, which is close but not the specific location.  I'll try searching again with more specific terms, as sometimes more detail helps OsmAnd find smaller locations.
Summary: Summary of this step: Typed "Nendeln village, Liechtenstein" into the search bar (index 1) to try a more specific search term, but OsmAnd still couldn't find the exact location, suggesting to increase search radius.

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: The search for "Nendeln village, Liechtenstein" returned no results even after increasing the search radius.  It's possible the location is not precisely mapped in OsmAnd. I'll try searching for just "Nendeln" again and see if any nearby results appear that I can then manually navigate to.
Summary: Clicked the clear button (index 3) to remove the previous search term "Nendeln village, Liechtenstein" and prepare for a new search.

Completed step 11.
----------step 12
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "Nendeln", "index": 2}
Reason: Since the search for "Nendeln village, Liechtenstein" was unsuccessful, try searching for just "Nendeln" to see if the broader search yields a result.  Start by entering the text into the search bar.
Summary: Summary of this step: Entered "Nendeln" in the search bar; search results are displayed, but no location in Liechtenstein is found, only locations in Austria and Switzerland.

Completed step 12.
----------step 13
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: The search for "Nendeln" yielded results in Austria and Switzerland, but not Liechtenstein.  Since increasing the search radius didn't help, I'll try a more specific search term again, this time including "Liechtenstein". I will clear the current search text first.
Summary: Clicked the clear button (index 3) to remove the previous search term "Nendeln" to prepare for a more specific search.

----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "OsmAnd"}
Reason: The goal is to add a favorite location marker in OsmAnd. OsmAnd is not open, so the first step is to open the OsmAnd app.
Summary: Opened OsmAnd app successfully.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: I need to search for the coordinates provided. The search button is the most straightforward way to enter coordinates in OsmAnd.
Summary: Clicked the search button (index 3) to enter the provided coordinates, and the search screen appeared as expected.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "input_text", "text": "47.0688832, 9.5061564", "index": 2}
Reason: I need to input the coordinates 47.0688832, 9.5061564 into the search bar. The search bar is at index 2.
Summary: Summary of this step: Entered coordinates "47.0688832, 9.5061564" into the search bar (index 2); search is in progress, indicated by a progress bar.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: The search returned a location in Liechtenstein, which matches the provided coordinates.  I'll click on this result to view it on the map.
Summary: Clicked the search result "47.06888° N, 9.50616° E" in Liechtenstein, successfully displaying the location on the map.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: The "DETAILS" button (index 6) should lead to more options related to the selected location, including adding a favorite marker.
Error calling LLM, will retry in {retry_delay} seconds
None Stream removed
Summary: Clicked "DETAILS" to access more location options, but it unexpectedly opened a slightly different context menu with "COLLAPSE" and nearby Wikipedia articles instead.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: The current context menu doesn't offer options to add a favorite.  I need to dismiss this menu and try a long-press on the map location itself to see if that brings up the correct context menu. Clicking "COLLAPSE" (index 1) should close the current menu.
Summary: Clicked "Collapse" to close the context menu, which successfully dismissed the menu as expected.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: The DETAILS button is present and clickable, so trying again to access the details view for the location.
Summary: Clicked "DETAILS" to view location details, but it unexpectedly expanded the context menu instead.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: The app opened a context menu related to nearby Wikipedia articles instead of location details. This suggests the map might be in a mode where it prioritizes Wikipedia information.  I'll try collapsing this menu and then long-pressing the location to see if it brings up a different context menu with options for adding a favorite.
Summary: Clicked the collapse button (index 1) to close the Wikipedia context menu, hoping to then long-press for location details.

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "long_press", "index": 0}
Reason: The DETAILS button didn't work as expected, and clicking it repeatedly seems to just toggle the context menu.  I'll try a long-press on the map area (index 0) itself, as this is a common way to interact with map locations and might bring up the desired options.
Summary: Long-pressed the map area (index 0) to try and bring up location-based options, as clicking DETAILS didn't work; a download progress bar appeared, suggesting potential map data download.

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 0}
Reason: The DETAILS button is not working as expected, and the long-press is also not providing the desired menu.  Let's try tapping the map again, sometimes a simple tap can bring up the context menu with options to add a favorite.
Summary: Clicked the map to try and bring up the context menu for adding a favorite location, but the screen did not change significantly, suggesting the tap may not have registered or the menu is not triggered this way.

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "wait"}
Reason: The attempts to interact with the location marker through clicking and long-pressing haven't worked as expected.  It's possible the map needs to settle or refresh after the download in the previous step. Waiting might allow the UI to become responsive to interactions again.
Summary: Waited for the map to settle and become responsive after the download, but the UI appears unchanged.

Completed step 11.
----------step 12
Action: {"action_type": "wait"}
Reason: The attempts to interact with the map through clicks and long presses haven't yielded the expected context menu for adding a favorite.  It's possible the map needs more time to fully load or the interaction points are slightly off. Waiting a bit longer and then trying a long press again might be helpful.
Summary: Waited for the map to load further, but no UI changes were observed.

Completed step 12.
----------step 13
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The app is not responding to clicks or long presses in the expected way.  It's possible there's an issue with the app's state or some overlay is blocking interaction. Navigating back and then returning to the search result might reset the app's state and allow for proper interaction with the location.
Summary: Navigated back from the unresponsive search result screen to potentially resolve the issue and allow interaction upon returning.

Running task OsmAndFavorite with goal "Add a favorite location marker for 47.2165476, 9.5699984 in the OsmAnd maps app."
----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "OsmAnd"}
Reason: The goal is to add a favorite location marker in OsmAnd. OsmAnd is not open. Thus, the first step is to open OsmAnd.
Summary: Opened OsmAnd app successfully.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "long_press", "index": 1}
Reason: Long press the map to bring up the context menu for adding a favorite location.
Summary: Long-pressed the map to bring up the context menu, which appeared successfully.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 6}
Reason: Click "Add Marker" to add a marker at the current location.
Summary: Clicked "DETAILS" to view more details about the current location, but this opened a menu with options like "COLLAPSE" and "NAVIGATION", and information about nearby Wikipedia articles and online photos.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The app opened the details menu instead of allowing me to add a favorite location. I will navigate back to the map view and try a long press again.
Summary: Navigated back to the map view after accidentally opening the details menu instead of the add favorite location menu.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "long_press", "index": 0}
Reason: I need to long press on the map to bring up the context menu. This time, I will try to avoid clicking the "DETAILS" button, which led to the wrong menu in the previous attempt.
Summary: Summary of this step: Long-pressed on the map to bring up the context menu for adding a favorite location.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 0}
Reason: The UI elements show "Add Marker", indicating the ability to add a marker.  Clicking this area should open the marker details for editing.
Summary: Clicked the map (index 0) to trigger the add marker flow; the screen updated and now shows "My Position" and "Downloading list of available regions…".

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "wait"}
Reason: The app is downloading the list of regions.  Wait for the download to complete before proceeding.
Summary: Waited for the region list to download, but the screen did not change, suggesting the download is still in progress or there might be a network issue.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "wait"}
Reason: The app indicates "No internet".  The download of regions is likely blocked due to lack of internet connectivity.  I'll try waiting a bit longer to see if the connection is restored.
Summary: Waited for internet connection to be restored, but it remains unavailable.

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_home"}
Reason: The app indicates "No internet". Adding a favorite location with specific coordinates likely requires internet access for map data and location services.  Since waiting hasn't resolved the connection issue, I'll try navigating back to the home screen and checking the internet connection there. This will help determine if the problem is specific to the OsmAnd app or a wider system issue.
Summary: Navigated to the home screen to troubleshoot the "No internet" issue in OsmAnd and determine if it's an app-specific or system-wide problem.

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down", "index": 0}
Reason: The current goal is to add a favorite location marker in OsmAnd, but there's no internet connection, preventing the app from functioning correctly.  The "No internet" notification suggests a connectivity problem. To resolve this, I'll try turning airplane mode on and off, a common troubleshooting step for network issues. This requires accessing the quick settings panel.
Summary: Scrolled down the home screen app list to find OsmAnd, but it wasn't visible and the scroll reached the bottom.

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 27}
Reason: OsmAnd is now visible on the home screen, so click it to open and retry adding the favorite location. The internet issue might have been resolved while the phone was on the home screen.
Summary: Clicked OsmAnd app icon to open it.

Completed step 11.
----------step 12
Action: {"action_type": "wait"}
Reason: The app has opened to the map view, but there's still a "No internet" notification.  I need to ensure internet connectivity before proceeding with adding the marker. I'll try waiting a bit longer to see if the connection is restored.
Summary: Waited for internet connection to be established, but it remained unavailable.

Completed step 12.
----------step 13
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_home"}
Reason: The app indicates "No internet".  I'll try turning airplane mode on and off to reset the network connection, which might resolve the issue. Since I'm already in the app, I'll navigate back to the home screen to access quick settings.
Summary: Navigated to the home screen to access quick settings and attempt to reset the network connection by toggling airplane mode.
