Running task: FilesDeleteFile
=============================
Running task FilesDeleteFile with goal "Delete the file q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3 from the Android filesystem located in the Notifications folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area."
----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Files"}
Reason: The request involves deleting a file from the Android file system. This usually requires a file manager app.  Since there isn't a file manager app visible on the home screen, I'll try opening the app drawer to see if a file manager is available there.
Summary: Opened the Files app to access the file system.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: The file is located in the Notifications folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.  I need to navigate to the Show roots option to change the storage location.
Summary: Clicked "Show roots" (index 1) to navigate to different storage locations, but the action opened the navigation drawer instead of directly showing storage roots.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The navigation drawer opened instead of the storage roots view. I'll navigate back to the main Files screen and try a different approach to reach the target file.
Summary: Navigated back to the main Files screen because the navigation drawer opened instead of the storage roots view.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: The Files app is open and we're on the Downloads directory. We need to navigate to the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area to find the Notifications folder and the target file.  We can try clicking the "Show roots" button (index 1) again, hoping it will work this time.
Summary: Clicked "Show roots" (index 1) to navigate to the root directory of the phone's storage, but it opened the navigation drawer instead.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The Files app is open, but the expected storage roots view is not displayed. The previous attempts to click "Show roots" opened the navigation drawer instead. It's possible that the UI element identified as "Show roots" is not the correct one or has a different function. To proceed, try opening the internal storage directly by clicking on "Internal storage" if it's visible on the screen. This is a more direct approach to navigating to the desired location.
Summary: Scrolled down to try and find "Internal storage" or "sdk_gphone_x86_64" but the screen content did not change, suggesting an issue with scrolling or the target element not being present.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_home"}
Reason: The Files app is open, but the expected storage root view isn't displayed.  The previous attempts to click "Show roots" and scroll haven't worked. It's possible the UI element associated with "Show roots" is not correctly identified or has changed.  As a next step, let's try navigating to the home screen and reopening the Files app to reset the app's state. This might resolve any UI issues and allow us to access the storage roots directly.
Summary: Navigated to the home screen to reset the Files app state because the expected storage root view wasn't displayed after clicking "Show roots" and scrolling.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Files"}
Reason: Re-open the Files app from the home screen to start the process again.
Summary: Opened the Files app to begin the file deletion process.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 8}
Reason: The Files app is open and displaying category shortcuts.  Need to navigate to the file system view to locate the file to be deleted. Tapping "sdk_gphone64_arm64" might lead to the correct location or a similar directory structure where the target file might reside.
Summary: Clicked "sdk_gphone64_arm64" in the Files app to navigate to that storage location; the screen transitioned to a file browser view showing files and folders within "sdk_gphone64_arm64".

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The goal is to delete `q2a8_fancy_banana.mp3` within the Notifications folder in `sdk_gphone_x86_64`. I am currently in `sdk_gphone64_arm64`.  I need to navigate back to the previous level to find the correct storage location.
Summary: Navigated back to the previous screen to find the correct storage location (`sdk_gphone_x86_64`).

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Files"}
Reason: Re-open the Files app to start from a fresh state and try to locate the correct storage location (`sdk_gphone_x86_64`).
Summary: Opened the Files app to start from a fresh state and locate the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: Clicking "Show roots" (index 1) has consistently opened the navigation drawer instead of directly displaying the storage roots. To reliably navigate to the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" location, it's necessary to use a different approach. Since the target location might be accessible through the navigation drawer, clicking the "Show roots" button to open the drawer is the next logical step.
Summary: Clicked "Show roots" button (index 1) to open the navigation drawer; however, it seems to have opened a different view than expected, potentially a categorized file view instead of storage roots.

Completed step 11.
----------step 12
Error calling LLM, will retry in {retry_delay} seconds
None Stream removed
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The Files app is currently displaying a categorized view, not the storage roots.  Navigating back might return to a view showing the storage locations.
Summary: Navigated back from the Files app categories view, hoping to see storage roots; the action was successful, and the Downloads folder is now displayed.

Completed step 12.
----------step 13
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: The goal is to delete a file located in the Notifications folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.  I need to navigate to the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage location first. Since clicking "Show roots" has consistently opened the navigation drawer instead of the storage roots view, I'll try a different approach. I'll click the "Show roots" button again, and if it opens the drawer, I'll navigate through the drawer options to find the correct storage location.
Summary: Clicked "Show roots" (index 1) to navigate to the storage root view, but it opened the navigation drawer instead, as observed in previous attempts.

Completed step 13.
----------step 14
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "FX File Explorer"}
Reason: The Files app is not behaving consistently in providing access to the storage roots.  The "Show roots" button, which should ideally lead to the storage locations, consistently opens the navigation drawer instead. Since previous attempts to navigate directly to the storage root have failed, it's necessary to explore alternative file explorers that might offer more direct access to the Android file system.

adb stderr: [None]
Completed step 14.
----------step 15
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_home"}
Reason: The Files app is in an unexpected state, and previous attempts to navigate to the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area have failed. Navigating home and reopening the app is a way to reset the app and try a different approach.
Summary: Navigated home to reset the Files app and try a different approach to reach the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area, as previous attempts within the app failed.

Completed step 15.
----------step 16
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Files"}
Reason: Open the Files app from the home screen to start the process of deleting the file.
Summary: Opened the Files app successfully.

Completed step 16.
----------step 17
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The agent needs to locate the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage area within the Files app. Since previous attempts using the "Show roots" button and scrolling haven't worked reliably, the agent will scroll down the list of file categories and locations to see if the target storage location appears.
Summary: Scrolled down to search for 'sdk_gphone_x86_64'; the target didn't appear, but more storage locations are visible.

Completed step 17.
----------step 18
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The agent is still searching for the 'sdk_gphone_x86_64' storage location. Since scrolling down once didn't reveal it, scrolling down again might bring it into view.
Summary: Scrolled down to find 'sdk_gphone_x86_64', but it is still not visible.

Completed step 18.
----------step 19
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The agent has attempted to locate the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage area multiple times within the Files app, but it hasn't been found. Scrolling down twice has revealed more storage locations, but not the target.  Since further scrolling might reveal the target location, scrolling down again is a reasonable next step.
Summary: Scrolled down the Files app list of storage locations to search for "sdk_gphone_x86_64", but it was not found yet.

Completed step 19.
----------step 20
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The agent hasn't been able to locate the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage area.  The agent will scroll down again to see if it appears further down the list. If it still doesn't appear, the agent will consider alternative strategies.
Summary: Scrolled down to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64", but it was not found; will need to try other strategies if it's not visible after further scrolling.

Completed step 20.
----------step 21
Action: {"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "infeasible"}
Reason: The agent has been unable to locate the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage area using various scrolling and navigation attempts within the Files app.  It's possible this specific storage location isn't accessible through the standard Files app interface on this emulated device.  Therefore, the agent will declare the task infeasible.
Agent stopped since it thinks mission impossible.
Completed step 21.
Agent indicates task is done.

Running task FilesDeleteFile with goal "Delete the file RtPP_cool_nest.mp3 from the Android filesystem located in the Ringtones folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area."
----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Files"}
Reason: The request involves deleting a file from the Android file system.  A file manager app is needed for this. I'll try opening the "Files" app, which is a common file manager on Android devices.
Summary: Opened Files app to delete a file from the file system.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: Clicking "Show roots" to view and select the desired storage location.
Summary: Clicked "Show roots" (index 1) to navigate to the root directory of the phone's storage; the action was successful, and the next step is to locate the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The UI shows "sdk_gphone64_arm64" but the goal is to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64". Scrolling down might reveal more options.
Summary: Scrolled down to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64", but it's still not visible.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The target storage location "sdk_gphone_x86_64" is not visible on the current screen. Scrolling down further might reveal it.
Summary: Scrolled down to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64" but it was not found, will scroll down more.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The target storage location "sdk_gphone_x86_64" is not visible on the screen yet. Continue scrolling down to try to find it.
Summary: Scrolled down to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64", but it is still not visible, and the list seems to end with "sdk_gphone64_arm64".

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "up"}
Reason: The target file is located within the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage area, which hasn't been found yet. Since "sdk_gphone64_arm64" is the last visible item and the target storage name is lexicographically smaller, it might be located above the current view. Therefore, scrolling up is necessary to potentially reveal the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage area.
Summary: Scrolled up to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64" but it is not visible yet.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "infeasible"}
Reason: The target file is located within the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" directory. Since scrolling down did not reveal this directory and scrolling up reached the top of the list, it's possible that "sdk_gphone_x86_64" is not available on this device. Therefore, I'm marking the task as infeasible.
Agent stopped since it thinks mission impossible.

----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The goal is to delete a file located in the "Ringtones" folder within the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage area.  I need to navigate to that storage location first. The current screen displays various storage locations. I'm looking for "sdk_gphone_x86_64", which is similar to the visible "sdk_gphone64_arm64". I will scroll down to see if "sdk_gphone_x86_64" appears.
Summary: Scrolled down to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64" but it was not found on the current screen after scrolling.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The target file is located within the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" directory. Since it wasn't visible after the initial scroll down, continuing to scroll down is necessary to locate it.
Summary: Scrolled down to find 'sdk_gphone_x86_64' but it is still not visible, will scroll down more.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The target file is located within the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" directory. Since it's not visible on the current screen, scrolling down further to locate it is necessary.

----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Photos"}
Reason: We need to open the Photos application to delete the image file.
Summary: Opened Photos app to delete the target image.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: The Photos app is open, but I need to navigate to the local files on the device to find the image to delete.  I'll click the "Library" tab to access local files. This is a common way to access device files within the Google Photos app.
Summary: Clicked "Sign in to back up" to potentially access local files, but the screen did not change, suggesting this button is for cloud backup and not local file access.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Files"}
Reason: The Photos app is not allowing access to local files, likely due to the sign-in issue.  The Files app provides a more direct way to manage files on the device.
Summary: Opened the Files app to access and delete the target file because the Photos app was inaccessible due to a sign-in issue.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4

Summary: Clicked "Show roots" (index 1) to view available storage locations; screen transitioned to a list of storage locations.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 8}
Reason: The goal is to delete `2023_02_28_strong_yacht.jpg` within the Pictures folder in the `sdk_gphone_x86_64` storage.  Since the Files app is open and storage locations are displayed, the next step is to locate and click on `sdk_gphone_x86_64` (or similar naming convention) to navigate into that storage area. Element 8 appears to be the target storage location.
Summary: Clicked on "sdk_gphone64_arm64" (index 8) to navigate into this storage area; it worked as expected and the next step is to locate and open the Pictures folder.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 23}
Reason: The goal is to delete `2023_02_28_strong_yacht.jpg` within the Pictures folder.  I've successfully navigated to the "sdk_gphone64_arm64" storage area. Now I need to find and open the "Pictures" folder. Element 23 has the text "Pictures".
Summary: Clicked "Pictures" (element 23) to open the Pictures folder; the folder opened successfully, as evidenced by the breadcrumb trail and the file list updating.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "long_press", "index": 21}
Reason: The target file, "2023_02_28_strong_yacht.jpg", is present in the current view (element 21).  I'll long-press it to initiate the selection process for deletion.
Summary: Long-pressed file "2023_02_28_strong_yacht.jpg" (element 21) to select it for deletion; selection successful as indicated by "1 selected" in the action bar and the file name being highlighted.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 3}
Reason: Click "Delete" (index 3) to delete the selected file.
Summary: Clicked "Delete" to delete the selected file "2023_02_28_strong_yacht.jpg", and a confirmation dialog appeared.

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 2}
Reason: Click "OK" to confirm the deletion of the file "2023_02_28_strong_yacht.jpg".
Summary: Clicked "OK" to confirm deleting "2023_02_28_strong_yacht.jpg"; the dialog closed and the Files app shows a "Deleting 1 item" message.

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "complete"}
Reason: The file deletion operation has completed, as indicated by the disappearance of the "Deleting 1 item" message and the absence of the target file in the current view. Therefore, the goal is complete.

----------step 1
Error calling LLM, will retry in {retry_delay} seconds
None Stream removed
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Files"}
Reason: The request involves deleting a file from the internal storage.  A file manager app is needed for this. Since there isn't a visible file manager app, I'll try opening the "Files" app.
Summary: Opened the Files app to access and delete the specified file.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: Clicking "Show roots" to navigate to the root directory of the phone's storage. This is necessary to access the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.
Summary: Clicked "Show roots" button to navigate to root directory; screen updated to show storage locations.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The goal is to delete a file located in the "Podcasts" folder within the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage area.  I need to navigate to that storage location. The current screen displays available storage locations. I'm looking for "sdk_gphone_x86_64", which is similar to the visible "sdk_gphone64_arm64". I will scroll down to see if "sdk_gphone_x86_64" appears.
Summary: Scrolled down to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64" but it was not found on this screen after scrolling.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The target file is located within the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" directory. Since it wasn't found after the initial scroll, continuing to scroll down might reveal it.
Summary: Scrolled down to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64" but it is still not visible, will scroll down more.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The target file is located within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area. Since it's not visible on the current screen, I'll scroll down further to try and locate it.
Summary: Scrolled down to find 'sdk_gphone_x86_64', but it was not found and 'sdk_gphone64_arm64' was visible instead.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "up"}
Reason: The target file is located within the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" directory. Since scrolling down did not reveal this directory and instead showed "sdk_gphone64_arm64", it's likely that "sdk_gphone_x86_64" might be located above the current view. Therefore, scrolling up is necessary to explore that possibility.
Summary: Scrolled up to find 'sdk_gphone_x86_64', but the screen content remained unchanged, suggesting the target directory might not be accessible through simple scrolling within this view.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "infeasible"}
Reason: The target directory 'sdk_gphone_x86_64' was not found after scrolling both down and up. This suggests it might not be directly accessible from the current view or might not exist.  It's possible the emulator's storage structure is different or the directory is hidden.  Therefore, it's best to declare the task infeasible.
Agent stopped since it thinks mission impossible.

----------step 1
Action: {"action_type": "open_app", "app_name": "Files"}
Reason: The goal is to delete a file.  A file manager app is needed.  Since there isn't one visible, I'll try opening the Files app.
Summary: Opened the Files app to begin navigating to the file that needs to be deleted.

Completed step 1.
----------step 2
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: Click the "Show roots" button to view the file system's root directories, which will allow navigation to the desired file location.
Summary: Clicked "Show roots" (index 1) to navigate to root directories; screen updated to show file categories and storage locations.

Completed step 2.
----------step 3
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The file is located within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area. Need to scroll down to find and click this location.
Summary: Scrolled down to find 'sdk_gphone_x86_64' but it is not visible yet, will scroll down more in the next step.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The storage location 'sdk_gphone_x86_64' is not visible on the screen yet. Scrolling down more to try to find it.
Summary: Scrolled down to find 'sdk_gphone_x86_64' but it is still not visible, may need to scroll more or check if the provided storage name is correct.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The target file is located within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area. I've scrolled down twice and still haven't found it. I'll scroll down once more to see if it appears.
Summary: Scrolled down to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64", but it was not found; will need to scroll down more or consider other navigation options if further scrolling yields no results.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The device name `sdk_gphone_x86_64` was not found after multiple scrolls down. It's possible the name is slightly different or the file is located elsewhere. It's time to try a different approach. I'll navigate back to the main Files app screen and check other storage locations or categories.
Summary: Navigated back to the main Files screen because the target storage location (`sdk_gphone_x86_64`) was not found within the currently displayed options, intending to explore other locations or categories.

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 11}
Reason: The current screen displays the Files app's main view.  Since the target file is an audio file located in the Alarms folder, it's best to start by navigating to the Audio category to narrow down the search. This will filter the files and potentially make it easier to locate the specific MP3 file.
Summary: Clicked "Audio" (index 11) to filter files by audio type; the filter was applied successfully, changing the displayed message from "No items" to "No matches in Downloads".

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: The file is expected to be in the Alarms folder, which might be accessible through the Audio category. Since there are no audio files currently visible in Downloads, it's necessary to navigate to other potential locations where the Alarms folder might reside. The "Show roots" option (index 1) provides access to different storage roots and categories, which could lead to the Alarms folder.
Summary: Clicked "Show roots" (index 1) to navigate to different storage locations, hoping to find the Alarms folder; the screen transitioned to a list of storage locations and categories.

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The target file is located within the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage area.  We need to locate and click this storage location to proceed. Since we're already in the storage roots view, we'll scroll down to try and find it.
Summary: Scrolled down to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64" but it was not found on this screen after scrolling.

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "up"}
Reason: The agent is searching for the specified storage location (`sdk_gphone_x86_64`). Since it wasn't found after multiple scrolls down, the agent will now try scrolling up in case it was missed or the list is ordered differently.
Summary: Scrolled up to search for 'sdk_gphone_x86_64', as it was not found after scrolling down.

Completed step 10.
----------step 11
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The target file is located within the `sdk_gphone_x86_64` storage area. Since scrolling up and down did not reveal this location, it's possible it might be further down the list.  Continuing to scroll down is the next logical step to explore this possibility.
Summary: Scrolled down to search for 'sdk_gphone_x86_64', but it's still not visible; will try scrolling down further.

Completed step 11.
----------step 12
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "up"}
Reason: The target file is located in the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage area.  Since scrolling down did not reveal this location, scrolling up might bring it into view if it's located above the currently visible items.
Summary: Scrolled up to find 'sdk_gphone_x86_64' but it was already visible at the bottom of the list and no other storage locations appeared.

Completed step 12.
----------step 13
Action: {"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "infeasible"}
Reason: The agent is unable to locate the specified storage location, 'sdk_gphone_x86_64'.  Since multiple attempts to scroll and navigate have failed to reveal this location, it's likely that the provided path is incorrect or the storage area is not accessible through the Files app. Therefore, the task is deemed infeasible.
Agent stopped since it thinks mission impossible.

Summary: Scrolled down to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64" but it was not found; "sdk_gphone64_arm64" is visible.

Completed step 3.
----------step 4
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "down"}
Reason: The target file is located within the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage area, which was not found after scrolling down. It's possible it's further down the list. Therefore, scrolling down again to try and locate it is the next logical step.
Summary: Scrolled down to find 'sdk_gphone_x86_64' but it was not visible on the screen after scrolling.

Completed step 4.
----------step 5
Action: {"action_type": "navigate_back"}
Reason: The target file is likely not present in the currently visible storage locations. Navigating back to the main Files app screen might offer other storage options or a different view that could lead to the target file.
Summary: Navigated back from the categories view to the main Files view to explore other storage locations for the target file.

Completed step 5.
----------step 6
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 11}
Reason: The file needs to be located within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage, which wasn't found in the storage roots.  Since the file is an mp3, clicking the "Audio" category will filter the files shown and might help locate it if it's in a different location than expected.
Summary: Clicked "Audio" (index 11) to filter for audio files in Downloads; the filter changed successfully, but the target file is still not visible, and the message changed to "No matches in Downloads".

Completed step 6.
----------step 7
Action: {"action_type": "click", "index": 1}
Reason: The file needs to be located within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage, which wasn't found in the roots view. Returning to the main Files view and clicking "Show roots" again to re-check the storage locations.
Summary: Clicked "Show roots" (index 1) in Downloads to navigate back to the root file view to locate the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage.

Completed step 7.
----------step 8
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "up"}
Reason: The agent is attempting to locate the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage location within the Files app. Since scrolling down didn't reveal it, the agent will now scroll up in case the target location is above the current view.
Summary: Scrolled up to find 'sdk_gphone_x86_64' but it's still not visible.

Completed step 8.
----------step 9
Action: {"action_type": "scroll", "direction": "up"}
Reason: The agent is attempting to locate the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage location within the Files app. Since scrolling down did not reveal the target, the agent will now scroll up to explore the upper portion of the storage list.
Summary: Scrolled up to find "sdk_gphone_x86_64" but the screen content remained unchanged, suggesting the target might not be present or reachable by scrolling in the current view.

Completed step 9.
----------step 10
Action: {"action_type": "status", "goal_status": "infeasible"}
Reason: The agent has attempted to locate the "sdk_gphone_x86_64" storage location multiple times without success.  It's possible this virtual device configuration isn't accessible through the Files app's standard navigation.  Therefore, the agent will declare the task infeasible.
Agent stopped since it thinks mission impossible.
Completed step 10.
Agent indicates task is done.
Task Failed ❌;  Delete the file ph0O_helpful_goat.mp3 from the Android filesystem located in the Ringtones folder within the sdk_gphone_x86_64 storage area.
